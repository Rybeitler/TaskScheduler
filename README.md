## Task Schedueling App
This was a group project done at the end of Coding Dojo's boot camp. The project was to not only show off our skills writing a full-stack app, but to work together using remote tools like github. For our project, we built an app to help employers schedule work for their employees. Using MongoDb users can make multi-teired accounts(managment or employee), and managers can create "tasks" and assign them to employees. We created this Project in React, with mongoDb, express, node.js and bootstrap.

## Features
* Working login/registration, with validations, stored in a MongoDB
* Persistant user login and validations using JWT cookies and a refresh token.
* Multiple user roles for management and employees, with protected access to features for both.
* Managers can create new tasks and assign them to employees
* Employees can veiw their tasks, as well as what is assinged to their fellow workers
* Employees can make notes, that managements can view, and mark tasks as completed
